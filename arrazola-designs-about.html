                    Arrazola Designs™ was inspired by our love for design and creativity. 
                    Proudly based in Los Angeles, California, we decided to embark on a new venture 
                    of sharing our passions with the rest of the world. We take into account every detail, 
                    from the type of paper used for invitations to the perfect font used in each personalized gift. 
                    Each and every design we create is inspired by our client's imagination in hopes of bringing their ideas to life.

                    Born and raised in Los Angeles, California we have been fortunate enough to be surrounded by diverse art, 
                    which has inspired our creativity and is found in our work. We have always wanted to start our own business 
                    together, but "never had the time." We soon realized that it's not about time, but rather taking the first step 
                    needed to begin the entrepreneurial process. Combining both our work expierences and educational background, we knew 
                    that creativity would be the focus of our business. Our personal touch and desire for perfection differentiates us from 
                    any other competitor. We take every client request to heart, as we want to ensure you love our products as much as we do. 
                    Each and every design is personalized to suit your event and/or business. You bring your imagination and we bring our creativity 
                    and together the possibilities are endless! ♡
